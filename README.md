# Telecom-Churn-projection
To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn.

Business Problem
In the telecommunications industry, where customers have the freedom to choose from various service providers and frequently switch between them due to intense competition, the sector faces an annual churn rate ranging from 15% to 25%. Given that it's considerably more expensive to acquire new customers than to retain existing ones, the focus has shifted toward prioritizing customer retention.

For many established telecom operators, the primary business objective is to retain their most profitable customers.

To combat customer churn effectively, telecom companies must proactively identify which customers are most likely to leave their services.

In this project, you will examine individual customer data from a prominent telecom company, construct predictive models to pinpoint customers at a heightened risk of churning, and pinpoint the key indicators contributing to customer churn.
